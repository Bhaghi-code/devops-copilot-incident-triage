# devops-copilot-incident-triage
**What this is**
This project is a lightweight AI-powered assistant designed to help on-call engineers quickly understand incidents by analyzing logs or incident text and producing structured summaries, root cause hypotheses, and recommended actions.

**Problem**
During outages and incidents, engineers spend valuable time scanning logs and alerts just to understand:
1.What is happening
2.Why it might be happening
3.What to check first
4.This slows down response time and increases cognitive load.

**Solution**
DevOps Copilot takes:
Raw application logs
Incident descriptions

And produces:
A short summary
Likely root causes
Recommended next steps
A ready-to-use incident ticket draft

**Who this is for**
SRE / DevOps engineers
Support engineers (Tier 2 / Tier 3)
Platform teams

**What I tested**
I used structured prompting with a large language model to:
Extract incident context from logs
Suggest root cause patterns
Generate actionable remediation steps
All examples in this repo use realistic but synthetic logs inspired by real production systems.

**Example Output (Sample)**
**Summary**
Increased 500 errors on /api/v1/devices
Downstream service timing out
Circuit breaker activated
**Likely Causes**
Downstream service outage
Network connectivity issues
Database connection pool exhaustion
**Next Actions**
Check health of downstream service
Validate network latency and errors
Inspect DB connection limits
**Incident Ticket Draft**
Title: Device API failures due to downstream timeouts
Description: Errors began spiking at 10:52 UTC due to repeated request failures

**Limitations**
Responses may contain assumptions
AI output should not be used without human validation
Requires monitoring and guardrails in real deployments

**Roadmap**
Future enhancements may include:
CLI tool support
Log ingestion from files or paste input
JSON output format
Jira integration
API-based deployment
